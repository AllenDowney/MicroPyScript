# MicroPyScript üî¨ üêç

A small, simple kernel of PyScript, made for testing purposes.

This is the way:

* Obvious code.
* Simple is good.
* No dependencies.
* Vanilla JavaScript.
* Pluggable.
* Comments.
* Tests.
* Build for change.

This is a solid foundation for lightweight testing of Python runtimes that
target WASM. Inspired by code in the "real" PyScript website and our plans for
plugins and simple event based coordination.

Complexity, edge cases and customization is (hopefully) confined to plugins and
bespoke runtimes.

That is all.

## Developer setup

In order to compile MicroPython you'll need to ensure you have the expected
dev tools described here:

https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/gettingstarted.html

Otherwise, common tasks are scripted by a Makefile (tested on Linux):

```
$ make
There's no default Makefile target right now. Try:

make setup - clone the required repositories.
make update - update the emsdk compiler.
make mp - compile MicroPython for WASM into the mpbuild directory.
make serve - serve the project at: http://0.0.0.0:8000/
make test - while serving the app, run the test suite in browser.
```

To get a working development environment with MicroPython run:

```bash
$ make setup
$ make update
$ make mp
```

To check things are working:

```bash
$ make serve
```

Then point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8000/ to see a "Hello World" from
MicroPython.

### What's in the files?

* **README.md** - this file, containing project documentation.
* **Makefile** - common tasks scripted into convenient targets. See above.
* **hello.py** - a simple "hello world" Python script for PyScript to run.
* **index.html** - a small web page that uses PyScript.
* **pyscript.js** - the simple, single file implementation of PyScript.
* **SpecRunner.html** - a web page to run the test specifications with Jasmine.
* **spec** - a directory containing the test specifications for Jasmine.
* **lib** - a directory containing the Jasmine test library.

To change the configuration of PyScript take a look at the JSON object
defined in the `<py-config>` tag in `index.html`. Currently valid runtimes are
`micropython` or `pyodide`.

## Running the tests

For the sake of simplicity (and familiarity) we use the
[Jasmine test framework](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) to exercise the
JavaScript aspects of our code.

Ensure the project is being served (`make serve`) and in a different shell, in
the root of this project, type `make test`. Your default browser should open
and run the Jasmine based test suite.

## How it works

The PyScript core only loads configuration, starts the Python runtime and
allows the registration of plugins. All other logic, capabilities and features
are contained in the plugins.

Currently, only a single plugin is provided by PyScript: the one that
implements the core `<py-script>` tag.

The story of PyScript's execution is roughly as follows:

1. Configuration is loaded from the `<py-config>` tag. Once complete the
   `py-configured` event is dispatched, containing the `config` object based
   upon default values overridden by the content of the `<py-config>` tag.
2. When the `py-configured` event is dispatched two things happen:
   * The runtime is loaded via injecting a `<script>` tag that references the
     runtime's URL. Once loaded the `py-runtime-loaded` event is dispatched.
   * Plugins are registered and have their `configure` function called. For each
     plugin registered a `py-plugin-registered` event is dispatched, containing
     the (potentially changed) `config`, and a reference to the newly registered
     plugin.
3. When `py-runtime-loaded` is dispatched the `config` is frozen and two things
   happen:
   * The runtime is instantiated / started. Once complete the `py-runtime-ready`
     event is dispatched.
   * All registered plugins have their `start` function called. 
4. When the `py-runtime-ready` event is dispatched all plugins have their
   `onRuntimeReady` function called with the `config` and `runtime` objects.
5. Any plugins registered after the runtime is ready immediately have their
   `configure`, `start` and `onRuntimeReady` functions called, with the
   `py-plugin-registered` event being dispatched.

That's it!

When `pyscript.js` is run, it creates a `window.PyScript` object that contains
read-only references to the `config`, registered `plugins`,
`availableRuntimes`, the `runtime` used on the page, an `isRuntimeReady` flag,
a `registerPlugin` function (see below) and a `runPython(code)` function that
takes a string of Python.

There are copious comments in the `pyscript.js` file. My intention is for
simplicity, lack of onerous dependencies (bye-bye `npm`), and
understandability. This code is good if it's easy to understand what's going
on. To this end, it's laid out in a "literate" manner, so the code "tells the
story" of this implementation of PyScript by reading it from top to bottom.

## Plugins

Plugins are inspired by Antonio's suggestion
[found here](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues/763#issuecomment-1245086859),
and should be relatively self explanatory.

Since simplicity is the focus, plugins are simply JavaScript objects.

Such objects are expected they have a `name` attribute referencing a string
naming the plugin (useful for logging purposes). Plugins should also provide
one or more of the following functions attached to them, called in the
following order (as the lifecycle of the plugin):

* `configure(config)` - Gives the plugin early access to the `config` object.
  Potentially, the plugin can modify it, and modifications will be visible to
  later steps and other plugins. Plugins must only modify the config at this
  point in their life-cycle. Examples of things which plugins might want to do
  at this point:
  - Early sanity check about their own options.
  - Rename/remap some options.
  - Add new packages to install.
  - Modify options for other plugins (e.g. a debugger plugin might set the
    option `show_terminal`).
* `start(config)` - The main entry point for plugins. At this point, config
  should not be modified by the plugin. Example use cases:
  - Define custom HTML elements.
  - Start fetching external resources.
* `onRuntimeReady(config, runtime)` - Called once the runtime is ready to
  evaluate Python code. Example use cases:
  - `pip install` packages.
  - Import/initialize Python plugins.

The following events, dispatched by PyScript itself, are related to plugins:

* `py-plugin-registered` - Dispatched when a plugin is registered (and the
  event contains a reference to the newly registered plugin). This happens
  immediately after the plugin's `configure` function is called.
* `py-plugin-started` - Dispatched immediately after a plugin's `start`
  function is called. The event contains a reference to the started plugin.
* `py-runtime-ready` - causes each plugin's `onRuntimeReady` function to be
  called.

If a plugin is registered *after* the runtime is ready, all three functions are
immediately called in the expected sequence, one after the other.

The recommended way to create and register plugins is:

```JavaScript
const myPlugin = function(e) {
    /*
    Private and internal logic, event handlers and event dispatch can happen
    within the closure defined by this function.

    e.g.

    const FOO = "bar";

    function foo() {
        const myEvent = new CustomEvent("my-event", {detail: {"foo": FOO}});
        document.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
    }

    function onFoo(e) {
        console.log(e.detail);
    }

    document.addEventListener("my-event", onFoo);

    ...
    */

    const plugin = {
        configure: function(config) {
            // ...
        },
        start: function(config) {
            // ...
            foo();
        },
        onRuntimeReady: function(config, runtime) {
            // ...
        }
    };
    window.pyScript.registerPlugin(plugin);
}();

document.addEventListener("py-configured", myPlugin);
```

Then in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="myplugin.js"></script>
<script src="pyscript.js" type="module"></script>
```

A good example of a plugin is the built-in plugin for the `<py-script>` tag
found in `pyscript.js` (search for pyScriptTag).

## Runtimes

The `Runtime` class abstracts away all the implementation details of the
various Python runtimes we might use.

To see a complete implementation see the `MicroPythonRuntime` class that
inherits from `Runtime`. There is also an incomplete `PyodideRuntime` class so
I was able to compare and contrast the differences between implementations and
arrive at a general abstraction (still very much a work in progress). Comments
in the code should explain what's going on in terms of the life-cycle and
capabilities of a "runtime".

The afore mentioned `MicroPythonRuntime`, `CPythonRuntime` and `PyodideRuntime`
all, to a greater or lesser extent, define a uniform shim around their
respective runtimes. The MicroPython one is most complete, but still needs work
as I make changes to how MicroPython itself exposes `stdout`, `stderr` and
consumes `stdin`.

## The future

Who knows..? But this is a good scaffold for testing different Python runtimes.

Next steps:

* More comprehensive tests.
* `CPythonRuntime` fully implemented.
* `PyodideRuntime` finished.
* `MicroPythonRuntime` refactored after making MicroPython play nicer with
  `stdout` and `stderr`.
* A plugin for a `<py-repl>` tag (the foundations are in place).
* A uniform way to `pip install` packages in each runtime.
* A uniform JavaScript gateway from within each runtime.
* A uniform `navigator` object through which to access the DOM from within each
  runtime.
* Running in web-workers (and associated message passing work), for each
  runtime.

That's it..! ;-)
