# PyScript Lite

A small, simple kernel of PyScript, made for testing purposes.

This is the way:

* Obvious code.
* Simple is good.
* Build for change.
* No dependencies.
* Pluggable.

This is a solid foundation for lightweight testing of Python runtimes that
target WASM. Inspired by code in the "real" PyTest website.

Complexity, edge cases, customization and mess is confined to plugins.

That is all.
